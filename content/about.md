My name is Noah Durbin and I am a software engineer in Boulder Colorado outside of my work I enjoy spending time outside rock climbing or on a bike with my wife Raen.

Prior to my entry into the world of software engineering I was a barista ans still very much enjoy specialty coffee. I also have spent time working on a boat, and have a degree in Intercultural studies and entrepreneurship.
