For the past seven months at Turing I have devoted nearly all of my time to learning, learning how to build software, learning how to work in a remote team of developers and more than anything I think learning how to learn. When people think of how to learn it is common to think of a teacher in front of a classroom giving a prepared lecture and instructions on how to do something. In reality most of us don't always have a teacher to teach us everything we will need to learn and learning how to learn something on ones own is crucial to success in any field and specifically as a software developer.

I know that I probably won't always work in the same technologies I do today. I enjoy working in ruby on rails but chances are I will work in other languages and frameworks. The principles I have learned will no doubt still be applicable down the road and that is what is important. I recently switched up how this site is built.
