It's been a lot of fun to build AI-powered applications, and it's exciting to see how fast this space is changing. While the app I am working on doesn’t use this gem, Langchain.rb provides many great tools that are worth checking out if you want to build with AI in your Ruby applications. I would definitely consider using it in the future for several reasons.\n\nEncourages experimentation\nAssistants and tools\nRAG, vectorized databases, and more\n\nEncourages Experimentation\nThe first reason is that it makes experimentation and development much easier and faster than if you were making calls directly to an LLM provider such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. At its most basic level, Langchain.rb is a layer on top of these LLMs that allows us to interact with them from one interface. This means we can easily swap out LLMs by changing just a couple of lines of code.\n\nInstantiating an LLM is as simple as the code above, and swapping it out for a different one is just as easy:\n\nThis way, you can explore how different LLMs perform in your application. With the landscape changing as rapidly as it is, where one model may outperform another on a month-by-month basis, it's nice to be able to try all available options.\nAssistants &amp; Tools\nAssistants and tools are another exciting aspect of Langchain.rb. Assistants allow you to create an instance of your LLM interface with instructions and access to various tools. There are built-in tools such as a calculator, weather, Google search, and more. When you create an assistant, you can simply specify the tools that you want it to have access to.\n\nHere, I gave my assistant access to a weather tool and a directions tool. These tools make API calls to fetch relevant information. Back at Turing, I worked on a project called \"Sweater Weather\" where we used similar APIs to get weather and directions data, providing directions from point A to B and forecasting weather upon arrival. The app could then let you know if it was sweater weather or not. I wanted to see if I could give an assistant access to these APIs to achieve a similar function—and it turns out, it works. When asked for directions, the assistant makes the appropriate calls, retrieves the directions, calculates the time of arrival, and provides the corresponding weather!\n\nThis line runs the user’s message in the Langchain.rb playground, allowing the assistant to automatically execute tools as needed.\nRAG, Vectorized Databases, and more\nLangchain.rb offers much more, and I’m excited about the possibilities of using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vectorized data storage. If you’d like to learn more, I encourage you to check out the project on GitHub, where you’ll find a folder of examples. You can also check out my repo for this small exploration.\n","id":"https://noahdurbin.github.io/blog/intro-to-langchainrb/","title":"Intro to Langchain.rb"},"https://noahdurbin.github.io/blog/reading-docs/":{"body":"Reading documentation is a big part of being a software engineer. It's hard to know all the tools and ways of doing things going into a project and reding documentation is how you can pick up the skills you need to solve the problems you come across. Documentation gives you the blueprints for how to use certain tools and frameworks. In my time as a developer I have frequently used the Ruby docs, rails docs, documentation for specific packages, and more; too many to count I'm sure. Even when using an ai tool like perplexity I am more likely to click into the linked documentation than read the given response.\nA couple weeks ago I was entrigued when I heard of someone who would not only read the documentation for the technologies they used but would also consult the source code. They had a scheduled day of the week where they would work through a section of source code and learn what was going on under the hood of the tools they relied on. I haven't dug into this practice yet but I am planning on it for a few reasons.\n1. deeper understanding\nThe biggest reason I want to spend time reading the source code of the tools that I use is that I want to have a deeper understanding of the tools I am using. In my case I want to start reading through the Rails source code. Being able to go beyond the documentation will make me realize on a deeper level that it isn't magic under the hood making everything work but something that someone has thoughtfully put together to make my life easier. If I know how somehting works to the point that I could put it together myself, I don't need to worry about it breaking, I'm no longer dependant.\n2. quicker development\nUnderstanding a tool on a teeper level will also give you what it takes to use it more efficiently. I don't want to be constantly lookking up why something isn't working the way I expect it to. Taking the time to read through how something works will give me what it takes to solve my problems faster.\n3. freedom\nHaving a deeper understanding of the tools you are using will give you the freedom to make it work the way you want. you can customize it to make it work the way you want. Maybe you will find out that other people have the same problem and you can help them out too. That is the great thing about open source problems is that you can make it better, but you can't make it better if you don't really understand how it works. If I take the time now to begin to understand Rails on a deeper level, down the road I can possibly share a gem that others will find valuable. I think that idea is really exciting and something I love about software development.\n\nI still have yet to do this, it is a goal of mine and something that I know is achievable. I know it will be slow going at first but I know will be workth it in th elong run. Part of the reason why I wanted to share this here is to keep myself accountable to doing this. I have a checkllist below of some of the different parts of rails I will be reading about and plan on adding a check and date for every one of these I make it through.\n\nActiveRecord\nActionController\nActionView\nActiveSupport\nRouting\nActiveJob\nActionCable\n\n","id":"https://noahdurbin.github.io/blog/reading-docs/","title":"Reading Docs"},"https://noahdurbin.github.io/blog/reframing-senior-as-mature/":{"body":"I am new to the world of software engineering, I've been at it full time for the better part of a year but I still feel like I am a novice among all the people around me with decades of experience. This last week at Boulder Ruby I heard a talk by Very Normal(Jesse) that has me thinking about my career as a software engineer and how I can be a \"senior engineer\" even while I am still in almost every sense of the word a Junior.\nThe thing about \"senior\" when it comes to engineering is that there are so many definitions of what it means to be a senior engineer, You can be at one company for a couple years and be given a title of senior engineer and move to another company and be given a lower title even though your skills and responsibilities may not have changed. The way I think about it i wonder if it would be more helpful to use a different term when referring to becoming a senior engineer. Instead of finding my definition of being a senior engineer in my job title, I wonder if it would be more helpful to think of it as being a \"mature\" engineer.\nOne definition of mature can be seen here \"mentally and emotionally well-developed, and therefore responsible.\" In the talk that Jesse gave this was my takeaway. While I think generally speaking this is what people think of when it comes to senior as well, senior carries some baggage that I don't think is helpful, at least with what my goal is. The nice thing about this is that I can make it my goal of becoming a mature engineer without relying on the status at my job of being a senior engineer and even then that will likely follow.\nI want to be a mature engineer as soon as possible. Even if my time as an engineer doesn't warrant the status of senior I can work and support my team by working as a mature software developer.\nHow do I become a \"Mature\" Engineer?\nTaking from Jesse's talk, we are going to want to focus on a couple of things,\n\nOwnership\nMentorship\nTransparency\n\nOwnership\nFor me and for others like me early on in our careers, the big one that I think we can focus on is Ownership. Ownership means that we take responsibility for our work, we get it done (the right things), on time, and with excellence. For me right now, this looks like being realistic with my timelines on what I am working on and not pretending that I am more competent than I am. This allows me to do the work I have well and doesn't put the responsibility on someone else or abandon my responsibilities; it pushes me to grow by forcing me to solve harder problems. When I am able to take ownership for my domain, my domain will have the chance to grow into that of a senior engineer.\nMentorship\nMentorship is interesting because as someone new in their career, it may feel strange to be mentoring someone, but at the same time, there is always going to be someone that knows less than you, and taking the time to help them out is going to help you grow. I think that being a mature engineer also means humility and that recognizing that I have things to learn means that I can be mentored as well and remain teachable even when down the road I am a mature, \"senior\" engineer. I think this prepares you as well for the days that you do have more to share. Being mentored will help you see how you can help people in your place later down the road.\nTransparency\nAs I reflect on the qualities of a mature engineer, transparency stands out as a powerful tool for professional growth. It's not just about being open with your work; it's about creating an atmosphere of trust and mutual support within the team. So much of this work is about working effectively in a team, being transparent will only help in that process. As someone that is newer in my career I can see this in the sense that if I am open and transparent with how I am doing in the tasks that I am working on and where I am struggling, others around me can know what to expect from me and also help me when and where they are able to. It comes back to humility in many ways. This isn't exactly what Jesse was saying and I think what he had to say had a lot of value as well, but for my current context this is how I am thinking about it.\nConclusion\nBy focusing on becoming a mature engineer rather than fixating on the title of \"senior,\" I believe I can develop the skills and mindset necessary for long-term success in software engineering. Through ownership, mentorship, and transparency, I can contribute meaningfully to my team and continue to grow professionally, regardless of my current job title or years of experience.\n","id":"https://noahdurbin.github.io/blog/reframing-senior-as-mature/","title":"Reframing Senior as Mature"},"https://noahdurbin.github.io/blog/testing-doubles/":{"body":"In my time at Turing we have had a heavy focus on test driven development. For the majority of what we have worked on we have had what I think are pretty straightforward architectures where testing is also fairly straight forward. Our models and methods we worked with had basic methods and structures. Testing in this type of scenario isn’t too complicated either, for example with a User model it isn’t difficult to simply create the user in the test setup using a typical syntax like\n\nIn this scenario we can simply call methods and test them this way. Later on when learning about testing external api calls we started to learn about mocking. There’s a few reason that we do this, we don’t want to keep making calls to an external api that may be costing us money. We might want to test multiple parts of one call, it would end up being wasteful to keep making the same call. What I didn’t realize about mocking at first is that it can be really useful in other testing scenarios too.\nThere are many advantages to mocking, when we are developing with TDD an advantage with mocks is that we can ‘create’ the object we are wanting to test on before we actually have the class that we are testing. Even if that isn’t the case and we already have the class that we are testing, when our apps get more complicated and interdependent mocking in tests allow us to quickly set up our tests without worrying as much about setup.\nRSpec has a built in way of doing this, doubles. Doubles are essentially a mock, and are simply a way thta we can create an object to stand in place for our real object we are testing. In RSpec one way we can use a double is the following\n\nin this line we create a double of the User class. This double is not a user itself but just a representation of the user. Since this double isn't a user itself it does not have any of the properties or methods of the user class, yet. We can do the following to give the double methods we want it to be able to respond to.\n\nThis allows our user method to mock rthe behavior of a user recieving the promote method. In a situation where we are not concerned with testing that user method we don't really need that behavior to play out. Mocking the bhavior let's us focus on what we are really wanting to test. Another benefit is that if the method we are mocking is highly compute intesive or maybe makes large network and database calls, we can skip that for the time being. If we want to simulate different edge cases and error conditions this is a way we can set that up, creating the exact scenario we want.\nWhen I first came across doubles I was very confused, it seemed like it wasn't actually testing anything, turns out I was focusing on the wrong part of the test. Now I see the value in being able to isolate test cases and get more granular with what we are testing. I look forward to implimenting this more in the future and hope that you were able to learn something too\n","id":"https://noahdurbin.github.io/blog/testing-doubles/","title":"Testing with Doubles in RSpec"},"https://noahdurbin.github.io/reading-list/":{"body":"Here is a list of technicalish books/audiobooks that I have read and listened to in no particular order.\nBookAuthor\nClean CodeRobert Martin\nLetters to a new DeveloperDan Moore\nDesigning Data-Intensive ApplicationsMartin Kleppmann\n\n","id":"https://noahdurbin.github.io/reading-list/","title":"Reading List"},"https://noahdurbin.github.io/resume/":{"body":"\nI am currently looking for employment, if you think my skillset may match what you are looking for please feel free to contact me.Linkedin, Github\n\nSoftware Engineer with experience building and maintaining software primarily in Ruby on Rails; Noah has a background in intercultural studies, entrepreneurship, and specialty coffee, which drives his passion for understanding people and building software that improves their lives.
